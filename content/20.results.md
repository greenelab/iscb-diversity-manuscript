## Results

We curated a dataset of ISCB honors that included 412 keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB and RECOMB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of Fellows named (2009--2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 1993--2019.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for all years from 1997--2019.
We included individuals who were honored multiple times as separate entries.
For example, Christine Orengo was a keynote speaker at RECOMB 2004 and became an ISCB Fellow in 2016, and thus was counted twice in this list.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We used authorships instead of authors as our metric for the field's composition under the expectation that honorees would be drawn in a manner weighted by the number of last author contributions.
Using authorships also does not require accurate name disambiguation, which is an open challenge.
We scraped PubMed for manuscripts written in English from 1993--2019 with the MeSH term ["computational biology"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22Computational+Biology%22%5BMeSH+Terms%5D+).
We downloaded the metadata of manuscripts published in these journals from PubMed, which provided 176,110 articles for evaluation.
For each article, we extracted its last author's fore name and last name for analysis.

### Technical Considerations for Representation Analyses

Defining an appropriate background distribution is key to determining the extent to which representation diverges from that background.
We were faced with multiple decisions as we sought to define a field-specific distribution.
We focused on four key decisions and have performed analyses in three different ways across those decisions (Fig. {@fig:versions}).
Our findings across different versions of the study were consistent with respect to the broad conclusions, though the numerical results differed.

Study progression.
In [version 1](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/v/711edb01f5335a4c1bb8e1e0575618586a7abf9b/) of this work, instead of last authors, we examined corresponding authors of articles in three well-recognized computational biology journals,
and the results were consistent with our findings in [version 2](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/v/6bda862974e77beb98697f39c18027683af158cb/), where we expanded the article dataset to include all PubMed articles with the MeSH terms "computational biology".
Finally, in [this version](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/), we used citation count to weight articles to account for the impact variation of research contributions.

In our first version of the analysis pipeline, we sought to characterize the distribution of authorships in the field using field-specific journals.
This resulted in an analysis set of 29,755 authorships.
We also examined corresponding authors, as we considered that senior authors may occasionally occupy a different position [@doi:10.1177/0306312716650046], and only fell back to last authors in cases where corresponding author annotations were unavailable.

In the next version of the analysis, we extended the analysis to all 176,110 computational biology PubMed articles, substantially increasing the sample size.
We also extracted names of last authors instead of other potential selections to better capture the honoree population.
Our assumption was that, among the authors of a specific paper, the last author (often research advisors) would be most likely to be invited for a keynote or honored as a fellow.
Also, the availability of information on corresponding authors was limited, and extracting last author became a more consistent approach.

In version 3, instead of weighting all articles equally as in the earlier versions, we used citation count to weight articles to control for the differential impact of research contributions.
Using citation counts has key limitations: female scientists of different disciplines are cited less often than their male counterparts [@arxiv:2001.01002; @doi:10.1002/ece3.4993; @doi:10.1038/s41550-017-0141].
Furthermore, the act of being honored, particularly with a keynote at an international meeting, could lead to work being more recognized and cited, which would reverse the arrow of causality.
We expected this approach to be overly conservative, leading to a failure to reject the null hypothesis of no disparities even if disparities existed.
We present this version of the results in this paper.
Parallel analyses for the other versions are available in supplementary figure S1.

Finally, in all versions of the analysis, rather than applying a hard assignment for each prediction, we analyzed the raw prediction probability values to capture the uncertainty of the prediction model.
Although we expect our estimates of disparities for citation-weighted analyses to be conservative, through each analysis, the overall findings remained consistent.
We recommend that researchers aiming to answer similar questions within their own fields approach these decisions with caution.
It may be most appropriate to perform the analyses at least with and without citation weighting to determine whether any disparities first exist when compared with the unweighted literature and second if those disparities are large enough to overcome existing disparities in citation patterns.

### Similar gender proportion between ISCB's honorees and the field

We observed a gradual increase of the proportion of predicted female authorships, arriving at an average of approximately 27% in 2017-2019 (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, left).
In recent years, ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers appear to have similar gender proportions compared to the population of authors published in computational biology and bioinformatics journals (averaged around 30% in the last three years, Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, right).
Examining each honor category, we observed an increasing trend of honorees who were women, especially in the group of ISCB Fellows (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/10.visualize-gender.html#sup_fig_s1)), which markedly increased after 2015.
Through 2019, there were a number of years when meetings or ISCB Fellow classes have a high proportion of honors for male honorees and none that appeared to have exclusively female honorees.
We sought to examine whether or not there was a difference in the proportion of female names between authorships and honors.
A multiple linear regression of this proportion for the groups and year did not reveal a significant difference (_p_ = 0.237).
Interaction terms did not predict the group of scientists over and above the main effect of gender probability and year.

### Honorees with Celtic/English names are overrepresented while honorees with East Asian names are underrepresented

We applied our Wiki2019-LSTM model to both our computational biology honors dataset and our dataset of authorships.
We found that the proportion of authorships with Celtic/English names had decreased (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, left).
Among keynote speakers and fellows, we found that the majority were predicted to have Celtic/English or European names (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, right).
When we directly compared honor composition with PubMed, we observed discrepancies between the two groups (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}B).
Compared to other names, there was an overabundance of Celtic/English name among the honors (OR~Celtic/English~ = 1.21, $\beta$~Celtic/English~ = 0.19, _p_ = 5.5×10^-4^).
Meanwhile, an East Asian name has significantly lower odds of being selected for an honor compared to other names (OR~East\ Asian~ = 0.19, $\beta$~East\ Asian~ = -1.67, _p_ = 6.0×10^-9^).
The two groups of scientists did not have a significant association with names predicted to be European and in Other categories (_p_ = 0.39 and _p_ = 0.45, respectively).
Interaction terms did not predict the group of scientists over and above the main effect of name origin probability and year.

  Compared to PubMed authorships, honors were more frequently associated with Celtic/English names and less frequently with East Asian names.
  We did not observe a statistically significant difference in other categories (see Table @tbl:example_names).

Consistent disparities were also apparent with an alternative approach that considered each pair of forename and last name as the unit of measurement.
In addition, a time-lagged model, which might be appropriate if we assume that honors accrue ten years after an authors most prolifically cited year, 
results in a similar underrepresentation of East Asian scientists' names in the group of honorees, though the effect size is smaller.
For example, the proportion of honor associated with East Asian name origins in 2019 is still substantially less than the proportion of senior authorships associated with East Asian names in 2009.
The [analysis notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/11.name-origin.html) for this portion provides the results in these scenarios.

We sought to disentangle geography from other factors by examining results for the country with the most affiliated scientists receiving honors, the US.
When applying the Wiki2019-LSTM model to the name origins of only US-affiliated scientists, we found a similar underrepresentation of honors to scientists with East Asian names (OR~East\ Asian~ = 0.17, $\beta$~East\ Asian~ = -1.77, _p_ = 4.3×10^-4^).
We observed no statistically significant difference between the proportion of honors given to authors with Celtic/English names, European names, or names in Other categories (_p_ = 0.60, _p_ = 0.11, and _p_ = 0.70, respectively).
Please see the [US analysis notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/14.us-name-origin.html) for more details.

### Overrepresentation of US-affiliated honorees

We analyzed the countries of affiliation between last authorships and ISCB honors.
For each country, we report a value of log~2~ enrichment (LOE) and its 95% confidence intervals.
The full table with all countries and their corresponding enrichment can be browsed interactively in the corresponding [analysis notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/12.analyze-affiliation.html#enrichment_tab).
A positive value of LOE indicates a higher proportion of honorees affiliated with that country compared to authors.
A LOE value of 1 represents a one-fold enrichment (i.e., observed number of honors is twice as much as expected).
In the 20 countries with the most publications, we found an overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US (119 speakers more than expected, LOE = 1.0, 95% CI (0.8, 1.2)) and Israel (15 speakers more than expected, LOE = 2.7, 95% CI (1.9, 3.4)), and an underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, India, South Korea, and Brazil (Fig. @fig:country-enrichment).

and the absolute difference between observed (triangle) and expected (circle) number of honors (right).

Countries are ordered based on the proportion of authorships in the field.
The overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US and Israel contrasts the underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, India, South Korea, and Brazil.

### Improvements to Honoree Diversity Subsequent to Our Primary Analysis

While our study was primarily designed to assess the diversity of honor recipients, the findings raise important questions about what can be done to address the disparities.
We examined changes subsequent to our initial report for suggestions that increased awareness may drive improvements in the practice of honoree suggestion.
We released [version 1.0](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/releases/tag/v1.0) of our manuscript on 2020-01-30.
Early indications suggested an increased the diversity of honorees.
In 2020, among 12 ISCB Fellows and 5 ISMB keynote speakers, the mean predicted probability of each honoree having an East Asian name was 33%, higher than any estimate in previous years (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/15.analyze-2020.html)).
The set of honorees also included the first ISCB Fellow from China.
Compared to past years, the 2020 honorees appeared to better reflect the diversity of scientists in the computational biology field.
These new results suggested: 1) deserving honorees who were members of under-recognized groups existed but had not been recognized, and 2) examining honoree distribution's alignment with the field may trigger changes that begin to address issues of unequal representation.
However, we note that this analysis dealt only with more senior scientists (the last authors on scientific manuscripts) in the context of honors and that many years of changed honoree distributions will be required for the set of honored scientists to better reflect the field's senior author contributions.
