### Curated Honorees and Literature-derived Potential Honorees

We curated a dataset of ISCB honorees that included 412 honorees who were keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB, RECOMB, and PSB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of fellows named (2009-2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 2002-2019.
Keynote speakers from PSB were available for all years from 1999-2020.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for all years from 1997-2019.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last or senior authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We used those published in [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics), [BMC Bioinformatics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/), and [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/) as a set of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We downloaded the metadata of manuscripts published in these journals from PubMed, which provided more than 30000 articles for evaluation.
However, although PubMed provides author order, it does not provide corresponding author information.

We downloaded article information from PubMed Central (PMC), which provides corresponding author information to directly measure the fraction of manuscripts for which last authors were also corresponding authors in these journals.
Of the 21411 articles in PMC's, the last author was also a corresponding author for 17401 of them.
Because the concordance was high and the PubMed set was more complete, we used the PubMed last author set for all subsequent analyses.

### Assessing Gender Diversity of Authors and Honorees

Although Bioinformatics was established in 1998 and BMC Bioinformatics in 2000, the metadata for these journal papers before 2002 only have initials for first and/or middle author names.
Therefore, without first and middle names, we do not have author gender predictions before this year.

There is a slow increase of the proportion of predicted female authors, arriving at just over 20% on average in 2019 (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}A).
We observe very similar trend within each journal, but estimated female proportion has increased the least in _PLOS Computational Biology_ (Supplementary Fig S1).
ISCB fellows and keynote speakers appear to be more evenly split between men and women compared to the population of authors published in computational biology and bioinformatics journals (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}B); however, it has not yet reached parity.
The overall increasing female proportion trend seems to be present in each honor category, especially in the group of ISCB Fellows (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}C), which seems to have markedly increased after 2015.
PSB has only one or two keynotes per year, so its estimated proportion of female speakers varies considerably (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}C).
However, the 2020 PSB keynotes were the only set of honorees across our analysis for which nearly all the probability was ascribed to female speakers.

### Assessing the Racial and Ethnic Diversity of Authors and Honorees

We predicted the race and ethnicity of authors and honorees using wru, which is based on US census data.
We found that an increasing proportion of authors in computational biology and bioinformatics journals had last names associated with selecting Asian as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig {@fig:racial_makeup}A).
This was primarily driven by publications in _Bioinformatics_ and _BMC Bioinformatics_ (Fig {@fig:racial_makeup}B, top).
We did not observe an increase at PLOS Computational Biology (Fig {@fig:racial_makeup}B, bottom).
A higher proportion of individuals who had last names associated with selecting white as a race/ethnicity category in the US census were ISCB honorees (Fig {@fig:racial_makeup}C) than authors (Fig {@fig:racial_makeup}A).
Separating honoree results by honor category did not reveal any clear differences (Fig {@fig:racial_makeup}D).

We directly compared honoree and author results from 1997 to 2020 for the predicted proportion of white, Asian, and other categories (Supplementary Fig S2).
We find that white honorees have been significantly overrepresented and Asian honorees have been significantly underrepresented since the year 2000.
Though we estimate the fraction of non-white and non-Asian authors to be relatively similar to the estimated honoree rate, we note that both are represented at levels substantially lower than in the US population.
The proportion of Hispanic authors and honorees at these venues may also be influenced by authors from Spain instead of Latin America and is likely to understate the extent to which minoritized scientists are underrepresented among honorees and authors.
