## Results

We curated a dataset of ISCB honors that included 412 keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB and RECOMB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of Fellows named (2009--2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 1993--2019.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for all years from 1997--2019.
We included individuals who were honored multiple times as separate entries.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts (see Methods).
We used authorships instead of authors as our metric for the field's composition under the expectation that honorees would be drawn in a manner weighted by the number of last author contributions.
Using authorships also does not require accurate name disambiguation, which is an open challenge.
We scraped PubMed for manuscripts written in English from 1993--2019 with the MeSH term ["computational biology"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22Computational+Biology%22%5BMeSH+Terms%5D+).
We downloaded the metadata of manuscripts published in these journals from PubMed, which provided 176,110 articles for evaluation.
For each article, we extracted its last author's fore name and last name for analysis.

### Defining metrics and a field-specific background

We were faced with a number of choices as we set out to examine representation within the field.
Here, we outline the choices that we made and the rationale for these choices.

For one step, we needed to determine whether the most appropriate unit for analysis was researchers or honor and authorship events.
We elected to perform the analysis at the level of honors and authorships, not individuals.
Our rationale was that, if a scientist was honored three times, these three honoree slots represented distinct selection processes and should be considered separately.
We also elected to use authorships instead of authors because name disambiguation can be error prone, and because the overall design of the work was to examine authorship distributions, the precise linking of researchers was not necessary to address the research question.
As such, we estimated the gender and origin of each last name of each given paper and honoree slot, but not how many papers an individual scientist has authored or how many times they were invited as speakers or named fellows. 
We also needed to determine whether or not authorships should be weighted by some property of the resulting manuscript, for example the number of citations.
We elected not to weight based on the concern that certain honors - in particular keynotes - could increase the exposure of the work and consequently increase citations which would add circularity to the analysis.

At another point, we needed to determine what the appropriate set of publications were to define a field-specific background distribution.
Defining this distribution  is key to determining the extent to which representation diverges from that background.
Practical options included selecting authors in key society-endorsed journals or selecting those based on some article metadata.
We elected to perform the analysis to all 176,110 PubMed articles with a computational biology MeSH term to generate the largest possible set of relevant literature.

We assumed that, among the authors of a specific paper, the senior author (often research advisors) would be most likely to be invited for a keynote or honored as a fellow.
Based on field-specific conventions, we could have selected the last or corresponding author.
We found that corresponding authors were often first and/or last suggesting that they were highly involved with more corresponding authors being last authors than first authors.
Given the convention and the observation that corresponding authors were more often last, we selected the last author as the most appropriate in this setting.

We present the results with the selected strategy (Fig. {@fig:workflow}); however, we performed this work through multiple iterations varying these parameters to examine the extent to which they influenced the results.
Our findings across different combinations of the above choices were consistent with respect to the broad conclusions, though the numerical results differed (see Methods and supplementary figure S3).

### Similar gender proportion between ISCB's honorees and the field

We observed a gradual increase of the proportion of predicted female authorships, arriving at an average of approximately 28% in 2017-2019 (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, left).
In recent years, ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers appear to have similar gender proportions compared to the population of authors published in computational biology and bioinformatics journals (averaged around 30% in the last three years, Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, right).
Examining each honor category, we [observed](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/10.visualize-gender.html#sup_fig_s1) an increasing trend of honorees who were women, especially in the group of ISCB Fellows, which markedly increased after 2015.
Through 2019, there were a number of years when meetings or ISCB Fellow classes have a high proportion of honors for male honorees and none that appeared to have exclusively female honorees.
We sought to examine whether or not there was a difference in the proportion of female names between authorships and honors.
A multiple logistic regression of this proportion for the groups and year did not reveal a significant difference (_p_ = 0.19).
Interaction terms did not predict the group of scientists over and above the main effect of gender probability and year.

### Honorees with Celtic/English names are overrepresented while honorees with East Asian names are underrepresented

We applied our Wiki2019-LSTM model to both our computational biology honors dataset and our dataset of authorships (see Methods).
We found that the proportion of authorships with Celtic/English names had decreased (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, left).
Among keynote speakers and fellows, we found that the majority were predicted to have Celtic/English or European names (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, right).
When we directly compared honor composition with PubMed, we observed discrepancies between the two groups (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}B).
Compared to other names, there was an overabundance of Celtic/English name among the honors (OR~Celtic/English~ = 2.39, $\beta$~Celtic/English~ = 0.86, _p_ < 10^-5^).
Meanwhile, an East Asian name has significantly lower odds of being selected for an honor compared to other names (OR~East\ Asian~ = 0.17, $\beta$~East\ Asian~ = -1.75, _p_ < 10^-5^).
The two groups of scientists did not have a significant association with names predicted to be European and in Other categories (_p_ = 0.11 and _p_ = 0.29, respectively).
Interaction terms did not predict the group of scientists over and above the main effect of name origin probability and year.

  Compared to PubMed authorships, honors were more frequently associated with Celtic/English names and less frequently with East Asian names.
  We did not observe a statistically significant difference in other categories (see Table @tbl:example_names).

Consistent disparities were also apparent with an alternative approach that considered each pair of forename and last name was the unit of measurement.
In addition, a time-lagged model, which might be appropriate if we assume that honors accrue ten years after an author's most prolifically cited year, 
results in a similar underrepresentation of East Asian scientists' names in the group of honorees, though the effect size is smaller.
For example, the proportion of honor associated with East Asian name origins in 2019 is still substantially less than the proportion of senior authorships associated with East Asian names in 2009.
The [11.visualize-name-origins](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/11.visualize-name-origins.html) analysis notebook for this portion provides the results in these scenarios.

We sought to disentangle geography from other factors by examining results for the country with the most affiliated scientists receiving honors, the US.
When applying the Wiki2019-LSTM model to the name origins of only US-affiliated scientists, we found a similar underrepresentation of honors to scientists with East Asian names (OR~East\ Asian~ = 0.15, $\beta$~East\ Asian~ = -1.89, _p_ = 3.4×10^-5^).
We observed no statistically significant difference between the proportion of honors given to authors with Celtic/English names, European names, or names in Other categories (_p_ = 0.15, _p_ = 0.02, and _p_ = 0.65, respectively).
Please see the [14.us-name-origin](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/14.us-name-origin.html) notebook for more details of the US-specific analysis.

### Overrepresentation of US-affiliated honorees

We analyzed the countries of affiliation between last authorships and ISCB honors.
For each country, we report a value of log~2~ enrichment (LOE) and its 95% confidence intervals (see Methods).
The full table with all countries and their corresponding enrichment can be browsed interactively in the corresponding [12.analyze-affiliation](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/12.analyze-affiliation.html#enrichment_tab) analysis notebook.
A positive value of LOE indicates a higher proportion of honorees affiliated with that country compared to authors.
A LOE value of 1 indicates that observed number of honors is twice as much as expected.
In the 20 countries with the most publications, we found an overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US (119 speakers more than expected, LOE = 1.0, 95% CI (0.8, 1.2)) and Israel (15 speakers more than expected, LOE = 2.7, 95% CI (1.9, 3.4)), and an underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, India, South Korea, and Brazil (Fig. @fig:country-enrichment).

Countries are ordered based on the proportion of authorships in the field.
The overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US and Israel contrasts the underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, India, South Korea, and Brazil.

### Improvements to Honoree Diversity Subsequent to Our Primary Analysis

While our study was primarily designed to assess the diversity of honor recipients, the findings raise important questions about what can be done to address the disparities.
We examined changes subsequent to our initial report for suggestions that increased awareness may drive improvements in the practice of honoree suggestion.
We released [version 1.0](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/releases/tag/v1.0) of our manuscript on 2020-01-30.
Early indications suggested an increased the diversity of honorees.
In 2020, among 12 ISCB Fellows and 5 ISMB keynote speakers, the mean predicted probability of each honoree having an East Asian name was 33%, higher than any estimate in previous years (see the [15.analyze-2020](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/15.analyze-2020.html) notebook).
The set of honorees also included the first ISCB Fellow from China.
Compared to past years, the 2020 honorees appeared to better reflect the diversity of scientists in the computational biology field.
These new results suggested: 1) deserving honorees who were members of under-recognized groups existed but had not been recognized, and 2) examining honoree distribution's alignment with the field may trigger changes that begin to address issues of unequal representation.
However, we note that this analysis dealt only with more senior scientists (the last authors on scientific manuscripts) in the context of honors and that many years of changed honoree distributions will be required for the set of honored scientists to better reflect the field's senior author contributions.
