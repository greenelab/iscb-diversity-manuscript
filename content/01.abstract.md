## Summary

Delivering a keynote talk at a conference organized by a scientific society, or being named as a fellow by such a society, indicates that a scientist is held in high regard by their colleagues.
To explore if the distribution of such indicators of esteem in the field of bioinformatics reflects the composition of this field,
we compared the gender, name-origin and country of affiliation of 412 honorees from the _International Society for Computational Biology_ (75 fellows and 337 keynote speakers) with over 170,000 last authorships on computational biology papers between 1993 and 2019.
The proportion of honors bestowed on women was similar to that of the field's overall last authorship rate.
However, names of East Asian origin have been persistently underrepresented among honorees.
Moreover, there were roughly twice as many honors bestowed on scientists with an affiliation in the United States as expected based on literature authorship.
<!-- almost three quarters of this excess was accounted for by a deficit of 89 honorees from China, India, France and Italy.
We found similar name origin disparities in an analysis of US-affiliated scientists as in our international comparison suggesting that disparities arise partly, but not exclusively, from geography. -->

A record of this paperâ€™s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information.
<!-- Short abstract
Delivering a keynote talk at a conference or being named as a fellow by a scientific society indicates that a scientist is held in high regard by their colleagues.
To explore if the distribution of such indicators of esteem in the field of bioinformatics reflects the composition of this field,
we compared the gender, name-origin, and country of affiliation of 412 researchers who had been recognized by the International Society for Computational Biology (honorees) with 34,050 researchers who had been the corresponding authors on papers in three leading bioinformatics journals between 1993 and 2019.
The proportion of female honorees was similar to that of the field.
However, names of East Asian origin have been persistently underrepresented among honorees.
Moreover, honorees with an affiliation in the US were overrepresented by a factor of 2.0.
Within the US, we found an excess of White honorees and a depletion of Asian honorees.
