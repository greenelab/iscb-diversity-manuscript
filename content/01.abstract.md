## Abstract

Professional societies and the conferences that they manage provide an important venue for the dissemination of scientific knowledge.
Being invited to deliver a keynote at an international society meeting or named a fellow of such a society is a major recognition.
We sought to understand the extent to which such recognitions reflected the composition of their corresponding field.
We collected keynote speaker invitations for the international meetings held by the International Society for Computational Biology as well as the names of Fellows, an honorary group within the society.
We compared these honorees with last and corresponding author contributions in field-specific journals.
We used multiple methods to estimate the race, ethnicity, gender, and name origin of authors and the recipients of these honors.
To address weaknesses in existing approaches, we built a new dataset of more than 700,000 people with name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and trained long short-term memory neural networks to make predictions.
Every approach consistently shows that white scientists are overrepresented among speakers and honorees, while scientists of color are underrepresented.
